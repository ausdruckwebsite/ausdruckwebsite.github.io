As soon as we arrived at the coastline where the view opened up to the main city, we understood why people were calling this ‘the Las Vegas of the Black Sea.’ Batumi really was a blinking and colorfully illuminated agglomeration of extravagant high-rises.</p>

<p>We looked for accommodations on Airbnb beforehand. Our first apartment was in one of the older districts of Batumi, a four-story house with an external staircase. Because the building was empty apart from us, we moved up one floor. Outside our bedroom window, we could see the new-generation high-rises towering above the tin roofs of the aged apartment blocks from the Soviet era. It promised to become an exciting stay.</p>
